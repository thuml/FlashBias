FlashBias: Fast Computation of Attention with Bias [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12044)

Attention with bias widely exists, such as relative position encoding in [Swin Transformer](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer), scientific prior encoding in [AlphaFold (Nature 2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w) and [Pangu-Weather (Nature 2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06185-3). Surprisingly, despite the common use of attention with bias, its targeted efficiency optimization remains absent.

This paper presents [FlashBias](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12044) based on the low-rank compressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many widely used attention biases, enabling 1.5× speedup for AlphaFold, and over 2× speedup for attention with bias in vision and language models without loss of accuracy.

## Get Started

**Check [./flash_bias](https://github.com/thuml/FlashBias/tree/main/flash_bias) for Triton kernel and comparison among FlashBias, FlashAttention, torch-complie, SDPA and xFormers.**

The following are some representative applications of FlashBias.

1. **Large language model** with ALiBi bias: See [./1_Language_Model](https://github.com/thuml/FlashBias/tree/main/1_Language_Model)
2. **Swin Transformer V2** with relative position bias: See [./2_Vision_Transformer](https://github.com/thuml/FlashBias/tree/main/2_Vision_Transformer)
3. **Transformer PDE Solver** with spatial distance bias: See [./3_Neual_Solver](https://github.com/thuml/FlashBias/tree/main/3_Neural_Solver)
4. **AlphaFold 3** with pair representation bias: [./4_AlphaFold3](https://github.com/thuml/FlashBias/tree/main/4_AlphaFold3)

## Usage

```python
from flash_bias_triton import flash_bias_func
output_flash = flash_bias_func(q, k, v, q_bias, k_bias, None, False, 1 / np.sqrt(headdim))
```

## Overall Comparison

A significant memory and running time reduction compared to vanilla FlashAttention.
