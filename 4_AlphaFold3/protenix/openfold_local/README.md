Openfold is a great work. We try to reuse it when building models. However, A few modifications has been made for our protenix project.

 * In [protenix/openfold_local/model/primitives.py](model/primitives.py), we add a custom [`Layernorm`](../model/layer_norm/) implementation, it accelerate protenix about 30%-50% during different training stages
